A Django-powered web application that leverages machine learning to predict mental health sentiment from user-provided statements.

## 🌟 Overview

MindPredict AI is an intelligent web application designed to offer users insight into their mental well-being. By entering a statement about their feelings or current situation, the application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the text and provide a predicted mental health status (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

The project features a secure user authentication system, allowing users to track their prediction history over time in a personal and private dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Prediction**: Utilizes a Scikit-learn based machine learning model to analyze and classify text
- 🔐 **Secure User Authentication**: Complete user management system with secure signup, login, and logout functionality
- 📈 **Personalized Prediction History**: Logged-in users can view detailed history of all past statements and corresponding predictions
- ⚡ **Dynamic & Asynchronous**: Smooth prediction handling using JavaScript's fetch API for seamless user experience
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for full responsiveness across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- 🗂️ **Clean Architecture**: Follows Django's best practices for scalable and maintainable project structure

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.x
- SQLite3 (development database)

**Machine Learning:**
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- NumPy

**Frontend:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- JavaScript (ES6+)

**Deployment:**
- WSGI

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful process:

1. **User Input**: Registered user navigates to the "Predict" page and enters a statement
2. **Backend Processing**: Statement is sent to Django backend via asynchronous request
3. **Text Vectorization**: Pre-trained TfidfVectorizer transforms text into numerical feature vector
4. **ML Model Inference**: Vectorized input is fed into the trained model.pkl for prediction
5. **Store & Display**: Prediction result is saved to user's profile and instantly displayed

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mentalhealthpredictor.git
   cd mentalhealthpredictor
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   *Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install manually:*
   ```bash
   pip install django scikit-learn numpy joblib
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create Superuser (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access Application**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### Database Configuration

For production, consider using PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mindpredict_db',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## 📊 Model Information

The machine learning model uses:
- **Algorithm**: Classification model (likely SVM, Random Forest, or similar)
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Output**: Mental health sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Set `DEBUG = False` in settings
2. Configure proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Set up static file serving
4. Use WSGI server (Gunicorn recommended)
5. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx recommended)
